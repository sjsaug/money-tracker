## Setup

There will be no info for the app unless you add some :

### `.env files`

- Create a .env in the project directory with your REACT_APP_API_URL(when running locally use [http://localhost:4000/api](http://localhost:4000/api))
- Create a .env in the /api directory with your MONGO_URL (url used for accessing your db on mongodb, use drivers option)

## Running Locally

In the project directory you can run :

### `yarn start`

This runs the app in the development mode.
- Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.

## Deploying App

In the project directory you can run :

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.
Your app is ready to be deployed!
- See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.
